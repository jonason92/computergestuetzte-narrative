We argue that even though Jupyter helps users perform complex, technical work, Jupyter itself solves problems that are fundamentally human in nature. Namely, Jupyter helps humans to think and tell stories with code and data. We illustrate this by describing three dimensions of Jupyter: 1) interactive computing; 2) computational narratives; and 3) the idea that Jupyter is more than software. We illustrate the impact of these dimensions on a community of practice in earth and climate science.},

	abstract = {Reproducibility has become a requirement in the hard sciences, and its adoption is gradually extending to the digital humanities. The FAIR criteria and the publication of data papers are both indicative of this trend. However, the question that arises is whether the strict prerequisites of digital reproducibility serve only to exclude digital humanities from broader humanities scholarship. Instead of adopting a binary approach, an alternative method acknowledges the unique features of the objects, inquiries, and techniques of the humanities, including digital humanities, as well as the social and historical contexts in which the concept of reproducibility has developed in the human sciences. In the first part of this paper, I propose to examine the historical and disciplinary context in which the concept of reproducibility has developed within the human sciences, and the disciplinary struggles involved in this process, especially for art history and literature studies. In the second part, I will explore the question of reproducibility through two art history research projects that utilize various computational methods. I argue that issues of corpus, method, and interpretation cannot be separated, rendering a procedural definition of reproducibility impractical. Consequently, I propose the adoption of ‘post-computational reproducibility’, which is based on FAIREST criteria as far as digital corpora are concerned (FAIR + Ethics and Expertise, Source mention + Time-Stamp), but extended to include further sources that confirm computational results with other non-computational methodologies.},

To support this vision, this Essay provides an overview of a selection of open science initiatives from the past 2 decades, focusing on methods transparency, scholarly communication, team science, and research culture, and speculates about what the future of open science could look like.

They are widely used by data producers to catalogue and publish digital assets and research data. Nowadays, research infrastructures (RIs) offer services not only for accessing and publishing data objects, but also for processing data based on user demands, e.g., via scientific workflows or third party virtual research environments. However, efficiently retrieving and sharing digital objects in a shared data processing environment requires knowledge of application access patterns as well as the underlying network level distribution. As the number and size of data objects increases, optimizing data discovery and access among distributed partners on shared infrastructure emerges as an important challenge for infrastructure operators to maintain quality of service and user experience. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that utilizes Information Centric Networking (ICN) to retrieve content based on PIDs while optimizing data access on shared infrastructure.},

	abstract = {The rapid increase of scientific digital assets in the last years has made clear that digital identifiers are crucial for effectively publishing, accessing and managing digital information in e-science contexts. From persistent keys for access to digital objects in network environments, the concept of persistent identifiers has been more recently extended to identify also physical objects like people, institutions and any type of relevant entity in the e-Science domain, opening the way to the creation of an integrated information space where a network of resources can be resolved, linked, navigated and analyzed, as the Linked Open Data approach envisions for the Web. However, the creation and full exploitation of this valuable network of connections is currently hindered by the fragmentation and lack of coordination of the digital identifier ecosystem. The aim of this paper is to propose an open, distributed and scalable infrastructure for interoperating existing Persistent Identifiers and other digital identifier systems (like Cool URIs) in e-science, overcoming geographical, disciplinary and organizational boundaries. The Digital Identifier interoperability infrastructure is presented as a cross-cutting solution of core services enabling interoperability at three different levels: identifier, co-reference and semantic.},

They are widely used by data producers to catalogue and publish digital assets and research data. Nowadays, research infrastructures (RIs) offer services not only for accessing and publishing data objects, but also for processing data based on user demands, e.g., via scientific workflows or third party virtual research environments. However, efficiently retrieving and sharing digital objects in a shared data processing environment requires knowledge of application access patterns as well as the underlying network level distribution. As the number and size of data objects increases, optimizing data discovery and access among distributed partners on shared infrastructure emerges as an important challenge for infrastructure operators to maintain quality of service and user experience. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that utilizes Information Centric Networking (ICN) to retrieve content based on PIDs while optimizing data access on shared infrastructure.},

	abstract = {A persistent identifier (PI or PID) is a long-lasting reference to a document, file, web page, or other object.
The term "persistent identifier" is usually used in the context of digital objects that are accessible over the Internet. Typically, such an identifier is not only persistent but actionable: you can plug it into a web browser and be taken to the identified source.
Of course, the issue of persistent identification predates the Internet. Over centuries, writers and scholars developed standards for citation of paper-based documents so that readers could reliably and efficiently find a source that a writer mentioned in a footnote or bibliography. After the Internet started to become an important source of information in the 1990s, the issue of citation standards became important in the online world as well. Studies have shown that within a few years of being cited, a significant percentage of web addresses go "dead", a process often called link rot. Using a persistent identifier can slow or stop this process.
An important aspect of persistent identifiers is that "persistence is purely a matter of service". That means that persistent identifiers are only persistent to the degree that someone commits to resolving them for users. No identifier can be inherently persistent, however many persistent identifiers are created within institutionally administered systems with the aim to maximise longevity.
However, some regular URLs (i.e. web addresses), maintained by the website owner, are intended to be long-lasting; these are often called permalinks.},

	abstract = {Persistent Identiﬁers (PID) are the foundation referencing digital assets in scientiﬁc publications, books, and digital repositories. In its realization, PIDs contain metadata and resolving targets in form of URLs that point to data sets located on the network. In contrast to PIDs, the target URLs are typically changing over time; thus, PIDs need continuous maintenance – an effort that is increasing tremendously with the advancement of e-Science and the advent of the Internetof-Things (IoT). Nowadays, billions of sensors and data sets are subject of PID assignment. This paper presents a new approach of embedding location independent targets into PIDs that allows the creation of maintenance-free PIDs using content-centric network technology and overlay networks. For proving the validity of the presented approach, the Handle PID System is used in conjunction with Magnet Link access information encoding, stateof-the-art decentralized data distribution with BitTorrent, and Named Data Networking (NDN) as location-independent data access technology for networks. Contrasting existing approaches, no green-ﬁeld implementation of PID or major modiﬁcations of the Handle System is required to enable location-independent data dissemination with maintenance-free PIDs.},

	abstract = {The FAIR principles define a number of expected behaviours for the data and services ecosystem with the goal of improving the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of digital objects. A key aspiration of the principles is that they would lead to a scenario where autonomous computational agents are capable of performing a ``self-guided exploration of the global data ecosystem,'' and act properly with the encountered variety of types, formats, access mechanisms and protocols. The lack of support for some of these expected behaviours by current information infrastructures such as the internet and the World Wide Web motivated the emergence, in the last years, of initiatives such as the FAIR Digital Objects (FDOs) movement. This movement aims at an infrastructure where digital objects can be exposed and explored according to the FAIR principles. In this paper, we report the current status of the work towards an ontology-driven conceptual model for FAIR Digital Objects. The conceptual model covers aspects of digital objects that are relevant to the FAIR principles such as the distinction between metadata and the digital object it describes, the classification of digital objects in terms of both their informational value and their computational representation format, and the relation between different types of FAIR Digital Objects.},

This ‘state of the field’ article on digital history seeks to encourage greater reflexivity in the discipline by providing a detailed overview of the local context. It highlights some of the longstanding projects that continue to dominate the digital history landscape, while also exploring newly emerging innovations, opportunities and challenges. Examining such topics as infrastructure and tool development, digital archives and repositories, big history, public history, digital methods, and teaching, the authors conclude that additional investment is required to support progress in the field, and to ensure that past projects and data remain accessible into the future.},

Although the potential benefits of institutional repositories are well researched and many funders and institutions already mandate open access publishing via gold or green open access routes, institutional repositories often struggle with lack of growth and sustained workflows for content recruitment. Institutions have come up with various (and often creative) workflows for populating their repositories, including institutional open access mandates, library-mediated self-archiving, fully or partially automated content harvesting and integrations between repositories and Current Research Information Systems (CRIS). Zayed University launched the ZU Scholars11https://zuscholars.zu.ac.ae institutional repository in fall 2021. Since the beginning, a semi-automated workflow was introduced to populate the repository with publication data from Scopus, Web of Science, Dimensions and Unpaywall using a custom R script. Full text files are added automatically for all Creative Commons licensed articles. This article describes the data harvesting and conversion process, its current limitations and plans for future development. The article also reviews similar content harvesting projects in the context of institutional repositories.},

	abstract = {Institutional repositories (IRs) have received considerable attention from researchers across disciplines and around the globe. They have potentially increased the public value, ranking, prestige, and visibility of researchers, and relevant universities. However, despite the important and rapid growth of research in this area, few efforts have been made to systematically review and integrate the findings from previous research studies or to examine the current state of study regarding IRs. The primary goal of this paper is to provide a better understanding and an in-depth review of the current state of study regarding IRs. This research uses a systematic literature review (SLR) and followed a protocol to properly organize the work related to institutional repositories. The data were collected from primary studies published from 2007 to 2018 from the six major databases (ScienceDirect, IEEE Explorer, Springer, ACM, Taylor and Francis, and Emerald insight). Several papers regarding IRs were reviewed, applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, and a total of 115 studies were included as the main part of this research. The results obtained from these studies indicated that the absence of knowledge of open access IRs among scholars and institutions and inadequate information and communication technology infrastructure were significant challenges behind the development of open access IRs. Meanwhile, enhanced visibility of the academic institution, increased local and global rankings, increased prestige and public value, and improved teaching, learning, and research development by the scholars of the institution were found to be the main benefits of institutional repositories. This paper also highlighted that most of the studies in this research area were focused on the ”deployment, implementation, and adoption” and ”benefits and challenges” of institutional repositories. The outcomes of this paper can assist future researchers by providing a roadmap of institutional repositories and highlighting guidelines for successful implementation of IRs in higher learning institutions.},

	abstract = {Appealing to external bibliographic systems is an inevitable stage when organizing in-house resources in research libraries and information services. On the one hand, data from external sources can be widely used when working with institutional repositories, e.g., at the stage of searching for data on the organization’s papers, creating alerts for new entries or exporting data using appropriate formats to cut the time for bibliographic metadata processing. On the other hand, the most complete data from in-house databases can be used for data correction in external bibliographic systems to increase data accuracy in the organization’s publication profiles and enhancing the visibility of bibliographic information for the scientific community. During this time of open science, the use of open access bibliographic systems is becoming more promising, especially in the light of expensiveness and other problems with access to commercial bibliographic products. The paper draws on a set of papers of one of the Russian Academy of Sciences organizations to demonstrate the facilities of open access bibliographic resources when working with institutional repository. We compare the previously used commercial systems Web of Science and Scopus with the open access Russian Science Citation Index, Dimensions, and Lens with regard to coverage of organizations’ papers, as well as external databases’ appropriateness for library technological processes.},

A combination of factors is often at play, including overburdened faculty, confusion about copyright, and lack of awareness. Adding to these barriers on the researcher side are resource constraints on the administrative side, with many libraries citing limitations in budget and staffing for institutional repositories.  Atkins Library at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte sought to address these issues by strategically leveraging citation and copyright information that already existed in Web of Science to grow their institutional repository, Niner Commons. Keeping user needs and staff limitations top of mind, Atkins Library launched a project to reframe the approach to increasing participation with the repository: instead of continuing to expect users to deposit works on their own, the library developed a service in which staff could quickly and sustainably deposit works on behalf of users.},

In place of a simple chronological list, narrative instead organizes our account in new sequences in order to illuminate the interplay of actors and events. We want hypertext narrative to do things we cannot achieve in print; though we may occasionally use links to introduce variation in presentation or in story; it is now clear that hypertext will most frequently prove useful in changing (or adapting) plot. After discussing the ways in which plot may be varied, I describe the use of stretchtext as a reaction against the perceived incoherence of classic hypertext narrative, demonstrate the limitations that conventional stretchtext necessarily imposes on hypertext narrative, and describe an implemented generalization of stretchtext that matches the expressive and formal capabilities of classical hypertext systems while appearing to be a mere stretchtext and while running within the confines of a Web browser.},

The upside is the explosive growth of data and compute resources that promise revolutionary modes of discovery and innovation not only within traditional knowledge disciplines, but especially between them. The challenge, however, is to build the large-scale, widely accessible, persistent and automated infrastructures that will be necessary for navigating and managing the unprecedented complexity of exponentially increasing quantities of distributed and heterogenous data. This will require innovations in both the technical and social domains. Inspired by the successful development of the Internet and leveraging the Digital Object Framework and FAIR Principles (for making data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable by machines) the GO FAIR initiative works with voluntary stakeholders to accelerate convergence on minimal standards and working implementations leading to an Internet of FAIR Data and Services (IFDS). In close collaboration with GO FAIR and DONA, the RDA GEDE and C2CAMP initiatives will continue its FAIR DO implementation efforts..},

of stakeholders since their publication in 2016. By intention, the 15 FAIR
guiding principles do not dictate specific technological implementations, but
provide guidance for improving Findability, Accessibility,
Interoperability and Reusability of digital resources. This has likely
contributed to the broad adoption of the FAIR principles, because individual
stakeholder communities can implement their own FAIR solutions. However, it has
also resulted in inconsistent interpretations that carry the risk of leading to
incompatible implementations. Thus, while the FAIR principles are formulated on
a high level and may be interpreted and implemented in different ways, for true
interoperability we need to support convergence in implementation choices that
are widely accessible and (re)-usable. We introduce the concept of FAIR
implementation considerations to assist accelerated global
participation and convergence towards accessible, robust, widespread and
consistent FAIR implementations. Any self-identified stakeholder community may
either choose to reuse solutions from existing implementations,
or when they spot a gap, accept the challenge to create the
needed solution, which, ideally, can be used again by other communities in the
future. Here, we provide interpretations and implementation considerations
(choices and challenges) for each FAIR principle.},

A total of four databases and snowball searching were used for the comprehensive literature review during 2011–2020; then, we were able to find 98 studies based on the inclusion criteria. Also, we used thematic method to review the relevant studies and identified three categories of dimensions in the research process, namely (1) the publication and sharing category including open access, open data, transparency and reproducibility, citizen science, and crowd sourcing; (2) the infrastructure and cultural category including open infrastructure, open education, open tools, budget mechanism, open culture, and communication; and (3) governance and evaluation including policies, governance, and the ethical principles associated with open science. Open science emphasizes the efforts to open and make the scientific research process more inclusive so as to engage the inside and outside actors in the research process.},

Our efforts towards openness therefore need to increase in scale and aim for a more ambitious target. We need an ecosystem not only where research outputs are openly shared but also in which transparency permeates the research process from the start and lends itself to more rigorous and collaborative research. To support this vision, this Essay provides an overview of a selection of open science initiatives from the past 2 decades, focusing on methods transparency, scholarly communication, team science, and research culture, and speculates about what the future of open science could look like. It then draws on these examples to provide recommendations for how funders, institutions, journals, regulators, and other stakeholders can create an environment that is ripe for improvement.},

	abstract = {Achieving Global Open Access explores some of the key conditions that are necessary to deliver global Open Access (OA) that is effective and equitable.
Often assumed to be a self-evident good, OA has been subject to growing criticism for perpetuating global inequities and epistemic injustices. It has been seen as imposing exploitative business and publishing models and as exacerbating exclusionary research evaluation cultures and practices. Pinfield engages with these issues, recognising that the global OA debate is now not just about publishing business models and academic reward structures, but also about what constitutes valid and valuable knowledge, how we know, and who gets to say. The book argues that, for OA to deliver its potential, it first needs to be associated with ‘epistemic openness’, a wider and more inclusive understanding of what constitutes valid and valuable knowledge. It also needs to be accompanied by ‘participatory openness’, enabling contributions to knowledge from more diverse communities. Interacting with relevant theory and current practice, the book discusses the challenges in implementing these different forms of openness, the relationships between them, and their limits.
Achieving Global Open Access is essential reading for academics and students engaged in the study of Library and Information Science, Open Access and Publishing. It will also be valuable and interesting to library and publishing professionals around the world.},

Drawing on detailed analysis of the literature and current practice in OA, as well as data collected in detailed interviews with practitioners, policymakers, and researchers, the book discusses what constitutes ‘theory’, and how the role of theory is perceived by both theorists and practitioners. Exploring the ways theory and practice have interacted in the development of OA, the authors discuss what this reveals about the nature of the OA phenomenon itself and the theory-practice relationship. 

Open Access in Theory and Practice contributes to a better understanding of OA and, as such, should be of great interest to academics, researchers, and students working in the fields of information science, publishing studies, science communication, higher education policy, business, and economics. The book also makes an important contribution to the debate of the relationship between theory and practice in information science, and more widely across different fields of the social sciences and humanities},

This Element examines the role played by OS principles and practices within contemporary research and how this relates to the epistemology of science. After reviewing some of the concerns that have prompted calls for more openness, it highlights how the interpretation of openness as the sharing of resources, so often encountered in OS initiatives and policies, may have the unwanted effect of constraining epistemic diversity and worsening epistemic injustice, resulting in unreliable and unethical scientific knowledge. By contrast, this Element proposes to frame openness as the effort to establish judicious connections among systems of practice, predicated on a process-oriented view of research as a tool for effective and responsible agency.

Eine fundierte Auseinandersetzung über ihre tatsächliche Bedeutung für das wissenschaftliche Publizieren findet leider nur in Ansätzen statt. Die zwei Beiträge dieses kleinen Buches möchten hier eine erste bescheidene Abhilfe leisten. Es handelt sich um Vorträge, die ich auf den Göttinger Urheberrechtstagungen der Jahre 2008 und 2009 gehalten habe. Der Titel des vorliegenden Buches ist programmatisch zu verstehen. Es geht um das Recht des wissenschaftlich arbeitenden Menschen, sich in seinem Streben nach Wahrheit und Erkenntnis in einer Weise mitteilen zu können, die nicht wissenschaftsfremden ökonomischen Zielen, sondern allein der wissenschaftlichen Sache selbst verpflichtet ist. Eine so verstandene Mitteilungsfreiheit ist die unabdingbare Voraussetzung dafür, dass echter wissenschaftlicher Fortschritt durch Erkenntnisaustausch, durch Diskussion und Kritik möglich ist. Kann eine Wissenschaft das Maß ihrer Sichtbarkeit nicht mehr selbst bestimmen, hört sie auf, eine freie Wissenschaft zu sein.},

Accordingly, the objective of this study is to provide an overview of one type of challenge, i.e., epistemological challenges with OS knowledge production, and their ethical implications. Based on a literature review, it (a) reveals factors undermining the envisioned benefits of OS, (b) identifies negative effects on knowledge production, and (c) exposes epistemological challenges with the various phases of the OS process. The main epistemic challenges are related to governance, framing, looping effects, proper data procurement, validation, replication, bias, and polarization. The ethical implications are injustice, reduced benefit (efficiency), increased harm (as a consequence of poor-quality science), deception and manipulation (reduced autonomy), and lack of trustworthiness. Accordingly, to obtain the envisioned benefits of OS, we need to address these epistemological challenges and their ethical implications.},

For this, we determined the requirements of an open science ecosystem and compared them with the characteristics of BT to prove that the technology suits as an infrastructure. We also review literature and promising blockchain-based projects for open science to describe the current research situation. To this end, we examine the projects in particular for their relevance and contribution to open science and categorize them afterwards according to their primary purpose. Several of them already provide functionalities that can have a positive impact on current research workflows. So, BT offers promising possibilities for its use in science, but why is it then not used on a large-scale in that area? To answer this question, we point out various shortcomings, challenges, unanswered questions, and research potentials that we found in the literature and identified during our analysis. These topics shall serve as starting points for future research to foster the BT for open science and beyond, especially in the long-term.},

Two core objectives (reliability and trust) and three main characteristics (transparency, openness and reproducibility) of Open Science can be identified but it is still too early for a broad definition of this growing movement. Its growth is happening in many disciplines and in diverse facets. This article presents an overview of how Open Science is introduced and established in all three science dimensions of research design, processes and publications. For the future, the benefits are analysed that Open Science is offering, as well as the challenges that it is facing. It can be concluded that it is desirable that all researchers collaborate in Open Science. Open Science can improve the different science disciplines, research practices and science in general. In that way, Open Science can contribute to overcome the post-truth age through increasing objective and subjective credibility of science and research. And in the long-term perspective, Open Science can improve the whole research, education, as well as our society.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, the prevailing trend in the science-society relationship is to engage with the broader public, which is beneficial for the public, scientific institutes, scientific findings, and the legitimacy of science as a whole. This article provides a broad review of the rapidly growing research on Open Science and identifies the gaps in the current knowledge for future research. The review focuses on the science-society relationship, such that knowledge from this field is summarised and systematised. Insight into the most salient topics, including science communication, public engagement with science, public cognition of science, and challenges and potential unintended consequences connected to interactions with the public are examined. The first section of the paper focuses on science communication which involves efforts and approaches to inform the public about science by the most effective means. The section on public engagement reviews how scientists and scientific institutions are increasingly involved in direct interactions with the public and different groups of stakeholders to make science more open. The section focusing on public cognition of science provides information about public knowledge, perception, and trust regarding science, which both determines and is formed by public engagement. Last, risks, ethical issues, and data issues connected to the implementation of Open Science principles are reviewed, as there are many unintended consequences of Open Science which are examined by this current research. In conclusion, research covering the science-society relationship is rapidly growing. However, it brings multiple challenges as well as opportunities which are captured and discussed in a variety of existing studies. This article provides a coherent overview of this field in order to bring more comprehensible knowledge to scientists, scientific institutions, and outreach professionals.},

	abstract = {Reproducibility has become a requirement in the hard sciences, and its adoption is gradually extending to the digital humanities. The FAIR criteria and the publication of data papers are both indicative of this trend. However, the question that arises is whether the strict prerequisites of digital reproducibility serve only to exclude digital humanities from broader humanities scholarship. Instead of adopting a binary approach, an alternative method acknowledges the unique features of the objects, inquiries, and techniques of the humanities, including digital humanities, as well as the social and historical contexts in which the concept of reproducibility has developed in the human sciences. In the first part of this paper, I propose to examine the historical and disciplinary context in which the concept of reproducibility has developed within the human sciences, and the disciplinary struggles involved in this process, especially for art history and literature studies. In the second part, I will explore the question of reproducibility through two art history research projects that utilize various computational methods. I argue that issues of corpus, method, and interpretation cannot be separated, rendering a procedural definition of reproducibility impractical. Consequently, I propose the adoption of ‘post-computational reproducibility’, which is based on FAIREST criteria as far as digital corpora are concerned (FAIR + Ethics and Expertise, Source mention + Time-Stamp), but extended to include further sources that confirm computational results with other non-computational methodologies.},

Our study explores the coverage of Crossref for tracking literature in the arts and humanities, which usually has a national or regional focus and targets domestic audiences. An analysis of the coverage of ERIH PLUS journals shows that Crossref indexes more sources than Scopus and includes additional journals from Eastern and Southern Europe and the Global South. Crossref limitations arise when analyzing the amount of metadata deposited by publishers. Just two-thirds of the journals deposit abstracts and ORCIDs and around a third deposit affiliations. The level of metadata completion for individual articles is lower, with major differences depending on the language of the document. Just half of the journals actually deposit references. As a result, Scopus retrieves more citations than Crossref, except for publications in German and French. Crossref represents a promising bibliographic discovery tool in the arts and humanities but is in need of improvement regarding the level of metadata completion.},

	abstract = {The sheer volume of records that government organisations, and thus government archives, work with on a daily basis means that there is a chance that relationships between individual records will not easily be captured and recorded. This paper begins by suggesting that the relationships described in archival catalogues will remain at the highest levels of abstraction unless they can be extracted using automated methods. Relationships that can be generated automatically are described in this paper. They will likely be less established than archivists are traditionally used to working with. For example, a so-called ‘fuzzy matching’ technique is discussed that may reveal the ‘points’ of similarity between two records. Extensible databases will be needed to store new links; flexible interfaces will be required to display them. This paper discusses some of the techniques that may currently be available for automatically identifying links between born-digital records by looking at what can be found in the data stream and the relationships digital formats inherently describe. The mechanisms described may be useful for sentencing as well as cataloguing and description. While one size will not fit all, some collections may benefit. The paper concludes by discussing briefly what this work will mean to the end user.},

	abstract = {The rapid increase of scientific digital assets in the last years has made clear that digital identifiers are crucial for effectively publishing, accessing and managing digital information in e-science contexts. From persistent keys for access to digital objects in network environments, the concept of persistent identifiers has been more recently extended to identify also physical objects like people, institutions and any type of relevant entity in the e-Science domain, opening the way to the creation of an integrated information space where a network of resources can be resolved, linked, navigated and analyzed, as the Linked Open Data approach envisions for the Web. However, the creation and full exploitation of this valuable network of connections is currently hindered by the fragmentation and lack of coordination of the digital identifier ecosystem. The aim of this paper is to propose an open, distributed and scalable infrastructure for interoperating existing Persistent Identifiers and other digital identifier systems (like Cool URIs) in e-science, overcoming geographical, disciplinary and organizational boundaries. The Digital Identifier interoperability infrastructure is presented as a cross-cutting solution of core services enabling interoperability at three different levels: identifier, co-reference and semantic.},

	abstract = {Large-scale digitization in Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums (GLAM) created the conditions for providing access to collections as data. It opened new opportunities to explore, use and reuse digital collections. Strong proponents of collections as data are the Innovation Labs which provided numerous examples of publishing datasets under open licenses in order to reuse digital content in novel and creative ways. Within the current transition to the emerging data spaces, clouds for cultural heritage and open science, the need to identify practices which support more GLAM institutions to offer datasets becomes a priority, especially within the smaller and medium-sized institutions. This paper answers the need to support GLAM institutions in facilitating the transition into publishing their digital content and to introduce collections as data services; this will also help their future efficient contribution to data spaces and cultural heritage clouds. It offers a checklist that can be used for both creating and evaluating digital collections suitable for computational use. The main contributions of this paper are i) a methodology for devising a checklist to create and assess digital collections for computational use; ii) a checklist to create and assess digital collections suitable for use with computational methods; iii) the assessment of the checklist against the practice of institutions innovating in the Collections as data field; and iv) the results obtained after the application and recommendations for the use of the checklist in GLAM institutions.},

	abstract = {In at least 400 European caves such as Lascaux, Chauvet and Altamira, Upper Palaeolithic Homo sapiens groups drew, painted and engraved non-figurative signs from at least {\textasciitilde}42,000 bp and figurative images (notably animals) from at least 37,000 bp. Since their discovery {\textasciitilde}150 years ago, the purpose or meaning of European Upper Palaeolithic non-figurative signs has eluded researchers. Despite this, specialists assume that they were notational in some way. Using a database of images spanning the European Upper Palaeolithic, we suggest how three of the most frequently occurring signs—the line {\textless}{\textbar}{\textgreater}, the dot {\textless}•{\textgreater}, and the {\textless}Y{\textgreater}—functioned as units of communication. We demonstrate that when found in close association with images of animals the line {\textless}{\textbar}{\textgreater} and dot {\textless}•{\textgreater} constitute numbers denoting months, and form constituent parts of a local phenological/meteorological calendar beginning in spring and recording time from this point in lunar months. We also demonstrate that the {\textless}Y{\textgreater} sign, one of the most frequently occurring signs in Palaeolithic non-figurative art, has the meaning {\textless}To Give Birth{\textgreater}. The position of the {\textless}Y{\textgreater} within a sequence of marks denotes month of parturition, an ordinal representation of number in contrast to the cardinal representation used in tallies. Our data indicate that the purpose of this system of associating animals with calendar information was to record and convey seasonal behavioural information about specific prey taxa in the geographical regions of concern. We suggest a specific way in which the pairing of numbers with animal subjects constituted a complete unit of meaning—a notational system combined with its subject—that provides us with a specific insight into what one set of notational marks means. It gives us our first specific reading of European Upper Palaeolithic communication, the first known writing in the history of Homo sapiens.},

This can include existing data curation standards, the establishment of data handling protocols, and the creation, when necessary, of community curation policies. Therefore, DMPs present a unique opportunity to harmonise project management efforts for optimising the formulation and execution of project objectives.


To harness the full potential of DMPs as project management tools, the SMART approach (i.e., Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound) emerges as a compelling methodology. During the initial stage of the project proposal, drafted SMART metrics can offer a systematic approach to map work packages (WPs) and deliverables to the overarching project objectives. Then, the Principal Investigators (PIs) can ensure the consortia that all the project potential intellectual assets (i.e., expected research results) were considered properly, as well as their necessary timelines, resources, and execution. It becomes imperative for data stewards (DSs) and governance policymakers to educate and provide guidelines to researchers on the advantages of developing well-curated DMPs that align results with SMART metrics. This alignment ensures that every intellectual asset intended as a research result (e.g., intellectual properties, publications, datasets, and software) within the project is subject to rigorous drafted planning, execution, and accountability. 
Consequently, the risk of unforeseen setbacks and/or deviations from the original objectives is minimised, increasing the traceability and transparency of the research data life cycle. In addition, the integration of Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) into this proposed enhanced DMP provides a systematic method to evaluate the maturity and readiness of technologies across scientific disciplines. Regular TRL assessments will allow PIs: (1) to monitor the WP progress, (2) to adapt research strategies if required, and (3) to ensure the projects remain in line with the drafted SMART metrics in the enhanced DMP before the project started. The TRLs can also help PIs maintain their focus on project milestones and specific tasks aligned with the original objectives, contributing to the overall success of their endeavours, while improving the transparency for the reporting and divulgation of the research results.


The paper presents the overall framework for enhancing DMPs as project management tools for any intellectual assets using SMART metrics and TRLs, as well as introducing suggested support services for data stewardship teams to assist PIs when implementing this novel framework effectively.},

Indeed, new insights are often obtained by combining data sets that were produced independently of each other, for example by combining data from outside an organization with internal data resources. As a result, there is a need to discover, clean, integrate and restructure data into a form that is suitable for an intended analysis. Data preparation, also known as data wrangling, is the process by which data are transformed from its existing representation into a form that is suitable for analysis. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art in data preparation, by: (i) describing functionalities that are central to data preparation pipelines, specifically profiling, matching, mapping, format transformation and data repair; and (ii) presenting how these capabilities surface in different approaches to data preparation, that involve programming, writing workflows, interacting with individual data sets as tables, and automating aspects of the process. These functionalities and approaches are illustrated with reference to a running example that combines open government data with web extracted real estate data.},

	abstract = {Python has emerged as one of the most popular programming languages, extensively utilized in domains such 
 
as machine learning, data analysis, and web applications. Python’s dynamic nature and extensive usage make 
 
it an attractive candidate for dynamic program analysis. However, unlike for other popular languages, there 
 
currently is no comprehensive benchmark suite of executable Python projects, which hinders the development 
 
of dynamic analyses. This work addresses this gap by presenting DyPyBench, the first benchmark of Python 
 
projects that is large-scale, diverse, ready-to-run (i.e., with fully configured and prepared test suites), and ready- 
 
to-analyze (by integrating with the DynaPyt dynamic analysis framework). The benchmark encompasses 50 
 
popular open-source projects from various application domains, with a total of 681k lines of Python code, 
 
and 30k test cases. DyPyBench enables various applications in testing and dynamic analysis, of which we 
 
explore three in this work: (i) Gathering dynamic call graphs and empirically comparing them to statically 
 
computed call graphs, which exposes and quantifies limitations of existing call graph construction techniques 
 
for Python. (ii) Using DyPyBench to build a training data set for LExecutor, a neural model that learns to 
 
predict values that otherwise would be missing at runtime. (iii) Using dynamically gathered execution traces 
 
to mine API usage specifications, which establishes a baseline for future work on specification mining for 
 
Python. We envision DyPyBench to provide a basis for other dynamic analyses and for studying the runtime 
 
behavior of Python code.},

It contains rich metadata about the publications, associated GitHub repositories and Jupyter notebooks, and the notebooks' reproducibility. We took this dataset, converted it into semantic triples and loaded these into a triple store to create a knowledge graph, FAIR Jupyter, that we made accessible via a web service. This enables granular data exploration and analysis through queries that can be tailored to specific use cases. Such queries may provide details about any of the variables from the original dataset, highlight relationships between them or combine some of the graph's content with materials from corresponding external resources. We provide a collection of example queries addressing a range of use cases in research and education. We also outline how sets of such queries can be used to profile specific content types, either individually or by class. We conclude by discussing how such a semantically enhanced sharing of complex datasets can both enhance their FAIRness, i.e., their findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability, and help identify and communicate best practices, particularly with regards to data quality, standardization, automation and reproducibility.},

	abstract = {Over the past decade, evidence from disciplines ranging from biology to economics has suggested that many scientific studies may not be reproducible. This has led to declarations in both the scientific and lay press that science is experiencing a “reproducibility crisis” and that this crisis has consequences for the extent to which students, faculty, and the public at large can trust research. Faculty build on these results with their own research, and students and the public use these results for everything from patient care to public policy. To build a model for how academic libraries can support reproducible research, the authors conducted a review of major guidelines from funders, publishers, and professional societies. Specific recommendations were extracted from guidelines and compared with existing academic library services and librarian expertise. The authors believe this review shows that many of the recommendations for improving reproducibility are core areas of academic librarianship, including data management, scholarly communication, and methodological support for systematic reviews and data-intensive research. By increasing our knowledge of disciplinary, journal, funder, and society perspectives on reproducibility, and reframing existing librarian expertise and services, academic librarians will be well positioned to be leaders in supporting reproducible research.},

	abstract = {To those involved in discussions about rigor, reproducibility, and replication in science, conversation about the “reproducibility crisis” appear ill-structured. Seemingly very different issues concerning the purity of reagents, accessibility of computational code, or misaligned incentives in academic research writ large are all collected up under this label. Prior work has attempted to address this problem by creating analytical definitions of reproducibility. We take a novel empirical, mixed methods approach to understanding variation in reproducibility discussions, using a combination of grounded theory and correspondence analysis to examine how a variety of authors narrate the story of the reproducibility crisis. Contrary to expectations, this analysis demonstrates that there is a clear thematic core to reproducibility discussions, centered on the incentive structure of science, the transparency of methods and data, and the need to reform academic publishing. However, we also identify three clusters of discussion that are distinct from the main body of articles: one focused on reagents, another on statistical methods, and a final cluster focused on the heterogeneity of the natural world. Although there are discursive differences between scientific and popular articles, we find no strong differences in how scientists and journalists write about the reproducibility crisis. Our findings demonstrate the value of using qualitative methods to identify the bounds and features of reproducibility discourse, and identify distinct vocabularies and constituencies that reformers should engage with to promote change.},

Synthetic data can be a powerful instrument for protecting the privacy of individuals, but it also presents challenges, such as ensuring its quality and authenticity. A well crafted synthetic data policy must strike a balance between privacy concerns and the utility of data, ensuring that it can be utilized effectively without compromising ethical or legal standards.

It opened new opportunities to explore, use and reuse digital collections. Strong proponents of collections as data are the Innovation Labs which provided numerous examples of publishing datasets under open licenses in order to reuse digital content in novel and creative ways. Within the current transition to the emerging data spaces, clouds for cultural heritage and open science, the need to identify practices which support more GLAM institutions to offer datasets becomes a priority, especially within the smaller and medium-sized institutions. This paper answers the need to support GLAM institutions in facilitating the transition into publishing their digital content and to introduce collections as data services; this will also help their future efficient contribution to data spaces and cultural heritage clouds. It offers a checklist that can be used for both creating and evaluating digital collections suitable for computational use. The main contributions of this paper are i) a methodology for devising a checklist to create and assess digital collections for computational use; ii) a checklist to create and assess digital collections suitable for use with computational methods; iii) the assessment of the checklist against the practice of institutions innovating in the Collections as data field; and iv) the results obtained after the application and recommendations for the use of the checklist in GLAM institutions.},

An analysis of the coverage of ERIH PLUS journals shows that Crossref indexes more sources than Scopus and includes additional journals from Eastern and Southern Europe and the Global South. Crossref limitations arise when analyzing the amount of metadata deposited by publishers. Just two-thirds of the journals deposit abstracts and ORCIDs and around a third deposit affiliations. The level of metadata completion for individual articles is lower, with major differences depending on the language of the document. Just half of the journals actually deposit references. As a result, Scopus retrieves more citations than Crossref, except for publications in German and French.

	abstract = {Summary There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

	abstract = {Reproducibility has become a requirement in the hard sciences, and its adoption is gradually extending to the digital humanities. The FAIR criteria and the publication of data papers are both indicative of this trend. However, the question that arises is whether the strict prerequisites of digital reproducibility serve only to exclude digital humanities from broader humanities scholarship. Instead of adopting a binary approach, an alternative method acknowledges the unique features of the objects, inquiries, and techniques of the humanities, including digital humanities, as well as the social and historical contexts in which the concept of reproducibility has developed in the human sciences. In the first part of this paper, I propose to examine the historical and disciplinary context in which the concept of reproducibility has developed within the human sciences, and the disciplinary struggles involved in this process, especially for art history and literature studies. In the second part, I will explore the question of reproducibility through two art history research projects that utilize various computational methods. I argue that issues of corpus, method, and interpretation cannot be separated, rendering a procedural definition of reproducibility impractical. Consequently, I propose the adoption of ‘post-computational reproducibility’, which is based on FAIREST criteria as far as digital corpora are concerned (FAIR + Ethics and Expertise, Source mention + Time-Stamp), but extended to include further sources that confirm computational results with other non-computational methodologies.},

	abstract = {Co-authored by a Computer Scientist and a Digital Humanist, this article examines the challenges faced by cultural heritage institutions in the digital age, which have led to the closure of the vast majority of born-digital archival collections. It focuses particularly on cultural organizations such as libraries, museums and archives, used by historians, literary scholars and other Humanities scholars. Most born-digital records held by cultural organizations are inaccessible due to privacy, copyright, commercial and technical issues. Even when born-digital data are publicly available (as in the case of web archives), users often need to physically travel to repositories such as the British Library or the Bibliothèque Nationale de France to consult web pages. Provided with enough sample data from which to learn and train their models, AI, and more specifically machine learning algorithms, offer the opportunity to improve and ease the access to digital archives by learning to perform complex human tasks. These vary from providing intelligent support for searching the archives to automate tedious and time-consuming tasks.  In this article, we focus on sensitivity review as a practical solution to unlock digital archives that would allow archival institutions to make non-sensitive information available. This promise to make archives more accessible does not come free of warnings for potential pitfalls and risks: inherent errors, "black box" approaches that make the algorithm inscrutable, and risks related to bias, fake, or partial information. Our central argument is that AI can deliver its promise to make digital archival collections more accessible, but it also creates new challenges - particularly in terms of ethics. In the conclusion, we insist on the importance of fairness, accountability and transparency in the process of making digital archives more accessible.},

Our overview of this growing body of literature is organised through the lenses of the Records Continuum model. We find four broad themes in the literature on archives and artificial intelligence: theoretical and professional considerations, the automation of recordkeeping processes, organising and accessing archives, and novel forms of digital archives. We conclude by underlining emerging trends and directions for future work, which include the application of recordkeeping principles to the very data and processes that power modern artificial intelligence and a more structural—yet critically aware—integration of artificial intelligence into archival systems and practice.},

	abstract = {Storytelling, and the delivery of societal narratives, enable human beings to communicate, connect, and understand one another and the world around them. Narratives can be defined as spoken, visual, or written accounts of interconnected events and actors, generally evolving through some notion of time. Today, information is typically conveyed over online communication mediums, such as social media and blogging websites. Consequently, the act of narrative delivery itself has shifted from simply imparting information through self-contained structures such as books, to more fragmented structures, such as social media websites, where evolving story events are constructed over multiple online sources. Ubiquitous online conversation can manifest into sophisticated narratives that have the potential to influence wide-spread user interpretations of cultural sentiments, attitudes, values, as well as geopolitical events and facts. As a result, narratives are actively being used as strategic tools for shaping local events, promoting collective opinions, and asserting ideologies and propaganda, making them sources of interest for identifying themes, intentions, and goals across multiple communities and potential adversaries. Identifying fragmented narratives, extracting thematic and temporal components that constitute evolving narratives, and locating signs of active rhetoric framing tactics, are difficult to detect and analyze without large-scale automation. This problem can be addressed through the use of natural language understanding technologies. Our goal is to document and discuss methods to efficiently construct, extract, and detect evolving online narratives. The novel contribution of this paper is the formal collation and documentation of such technologies and research areas, as well as extensive discussion on open research challenges and goals in the definition, identification, construction, generation, and representation of online narratives. To our knowledge, there is currently no existing formal documentation that organizes and provides extended discussion on narrative understanding research areas and open challenges.},

Capturing the drama of the race to decode this key to the ancient past, John Ray traces the paths pursued by the British polymath Thomas Young and Jean-François Champollion, the “father of Egyptology” ultimately credited with deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphs. He shows how Champollion “broke the code” and explains more generally how such deciphering is done, as well as its critical role in the history of Egyptology. Concluding with a chapter on the political and cultural controversy surrounding the Stone, the book also includes an appendix with a full translation of the Stone’s text.Rich in anecdote and curious lore, The Rosetta Stone and the Rebirth of Ancient Egypt is a brilliant and frequently amusing guide to one of history’s great mysteries and marvels.},

As early as 3000 B.C. sheets and rolls of papyrus provided an ideal surface for writing with a reed pen and pigments of carbon and red ocher. Egyptian scribes used papyrus for legal and administrative records, letters about business and personal life, as well as for literary texts and compendia of knowledge. Religious hymns and litanies were recorded, as were the great collections of formulae to secure life after death, the Books of the Dead. The authors examine the methods of making and conserving papyrus, the various scripts written on it, the writing practices of the scribes, and the different uses of papyrus under the Pharaohs and their successors, the Ptolemies and the Roman emperors. Egypt has preserved much Greek literature and administrative writings, and papyrus remained the writing material of the Mediterranean world until it was eclipsed in the ninth century A.D. by cloth paper from the Orient, ending a tradition that had lasted four thousand years.},

From the surge of ebooks to the self-publishing explosion and the growing popularity of audiobooks, Book Wars provides a comprehensive and fine-grained account of technological disruption in one of our most important and successful creative industries. Like other sectors, publishing has been thrown into disarray by the digital revolution. The foundation on which this industry had been based for 500 years – the packaging and sale of words and images in the form of printed books – was called into question by a technological revolution that enabled symbolic content to be stored, manipulated and transmitted quickly and cheaply. Publishers and retailers found themselves facing a proliferation of new players who were offering new products and services and challenging some of their most deeply held principles and beliefs. The old industry was suddenly thrust into the limelight as bitter conflicts erupted between publishers and new entrants, including powerful new tech giants who saw the world in very different ways. The book wars had begun. While ebooks were at the heart of many of these conflicts, Thompson argues that the most fundamental consequences lie elsewhere. The print-on-paper book has proven to be a remarkably resilient cultural form, but the digital revolution has transformed the industry in other ways, spawning new players which now wield unprecedented power and giving rise to an array of new publishing forms. Most important of all, it has transformed the broader information and communication environment, creating new challenges and new opportunities for publishers as they seek to redefine their role in the digital age. This unrivalled account of the book publishing industry as it faces its greatest challenge since Gutenberg will be essential reading for anyone interested in books and their future.},

	doi = {10.2218/ijdc.v18i1.919},
	abstract = {Data Management Plans (DMPs) are vital components of effective research data management (RDM). They serve not only as organisational tools but also as a structured framework dictating the collection, processing, sharing/publishing, and management of data throughout the research data life cycle. This can include existing data curation standards, the establishment of data handling protocols, and the creation, when necessary, of community curation policies. Therefore, DMPs present a unique opportunity to harmonise project management efforts for optimising the formulation and execution of project objectives.


To harness the full potential of DMPs as project management tools, the SMART approach (i.e., Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound) emerges as a compelling methodology. During the initial stage of the project proposal, drafted SMART metrics can offer a systematic approach to map work packages (WPs) and deliverables to the overarching project objectives. Then, the Principal Investigators (PIs) can ensure the consortia that all the project potential intellectual assets (i.e., expected research results) were considered properly, as well as their necessary timelines, resources, and execution. It becomes imperative for data stewards (DSs) and governance policymakers to educate and provide guidelines to researchers on the advantages of developing well-curated DMPs that align results with SMART metrics. This alignment ensures that every intellectual asset intended as a research result (e.g., intellectual properties, publications, datasets, and software) within the project is subject to rigorous drafted planning, execution, and accountability. 
Consequently, the risk of unforeseen setbacks and/or deviations from the original objectives is minimised, increasing the traceability and transparency of the research data life cycle. In addition, the integration of Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) into this proposed enhanced DMP provides a systematic method to evaluate the maturity and readiness of technologies across scientific disciplines. Regular TRL assessments will allow PIs: (1) to monitor the WP progress, (2) to adapt research strategies if required, and (3) to ensure the projects remain in line with the drafted SMART metrics in the enhanced DMP before the project started. The TRLs can also help PIs maintain their focus on project milestones and specific tasks aligned with the original objectives, contributing to the overall success of their endeavours, while improving the transparency for the reporting and divulgation of the research results.


The paper presents the overall framework for enhancing DMPs as project management tools for any intellectual assets using SMART metrics and TRLs, as well as introducing suggested support services for data stewardship teams to assist PIs when implementing this novel framework effectively.},

	abstract = {Reproducibility has become a requirement in the hard sciences, and its adoption is gradually extending to the digital humanities. The FAIR criteria and the publication of data papers are both indicative of this trend. However, the question that arises is whether the strict prerequisites of digital reproducibility serve only to exclude digital humanities from broader humanities scholarship. Instead of adopting a binary approach, an alternative method acknowledges the unique features of the objects, inquiries, and techniques of the humanities, including digital humanities, as well as the social and historical contexts in which the concept of reproducibility has developed in the human sciences. In the first part of this paper, I propose to examine the historical and disciplinary context in which the concept of reproducibility has developed within the human sciences, and the disciplinary struggles involved in this process, especially for art history and literature studies. In the second part, I will explore the question of reproducibility through two art history research projects that utilize various computational methods. I argue that issues of corpus, method, and interpretation cannot be separated, rendering a procedural definition of reproducibility impractical. Consequently, I propose the adoption of ‘post-computational reproducibility’, which is based on FAIREST criteria as far as digital corpora are concerned (FAIR + Ethics and Expertise, Source mention + Time-Stamp), but extended to include further sources that confirm computational results with other non-computational methodologies.},

Meta-research, or research-on-research, is a burgeoning discipline that investigates efficiency, quality, and bias in the scientific ecosystem, topics that have become especially relevant amid widespread concerns about the credibility of the scientific literature. Meta-research may help calibrate the scientific ecosystem toward higher standards by providing empirical evidence that informs the iterative generation and refinement of reform initiatives. We introduce a translational framework that involves ( a) identifying problems, ( b) investigating problems, ( c) developing solutions, and ( d) evaluating solutions. In each of these areas, we review key meta-research endeavors and discuss several examples of prior and ongoing work. The scientific ecosystem is perpetually evolving; the discipline of meta-research presents an opportunity to use empirical evidence to guide its development and maximize its potential.},

	abstract = {Scientific communication today is designed around print documents and paywalled access to content. Over the last decade, the open-science movement has accelerated the use of pre-print services and data archives that are vastly improving the accessibility of scientific content. However, these systems are not designed for communicating modern scientific outputs, which encompasses much more than a “paper-centric model of the scholarly literature”.


In this presentation, we will give a background on challenges with today’s tools for research communication \& collaboration, and present a vision for the future that follows the FORCE11 recommendations (Bourne et al., 2012). Specifically: (1) rethink the unit and form of scholarly publication; (2) develop tools and technologies to better support the scholarly lifecycle; and (3) add data, software, and workflows as first-class research objects.


We will discuss these recommendations in the context of (a) the ExecutableBooks community and new markup languages for scientific communication; (b) a collaborative writing tool called Curvenote that integrates with Jupyter Notebooks, and (c) new publishing tools that support networked scientific communication throughout the scholarly lifecycle.

	abstract = {GLAM organizations have been digitizing their collections and making them available for the public for several decades. Recent methods for publishing digital collections such as “GLAM Labs” and “Collections as Data” provide guidelines for the application of computational methods to reuse the contents of cultural heritage institutions in innovative and creative ways. Jupyter Notebooks have become a powerful tool to foster use of these collections by digital humanities researchers. Based on previous approaches for quality assessment, which have been adapted for cultural heritage collections, this paper proposes a methodology for assessing the quality of projects based on Jupyter Notebooks published by relevant GLAM institutions. A list of projects based on Jupyter Notebooks using cultural heritage data has been evaluated. Common features and best practices have been identified. A detailed analysis, that can be useful for organizations interested in creating their own Jupyter Notebooks projects, has been provided. Open issues requiring further work and additional avenues for exploration are outlined.},
